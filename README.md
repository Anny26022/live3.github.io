## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### 1. **Framework & Architecture**
- **Framework:** Built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/), enabling rapid development of data apps with a focus on interactivity and modern UI.
- **Directory Structure:**
  - `streamlit_app.py` ‚Äì Main entry point.
  - `pages/` ‚Äì Contains modular app pages: Advanced Scanner, Price Bands, Results, Stock News, etc.
  - `requirements.txt` ‚Äì All Python dependencies for reproducible deployment.
  - `style.css` ‚Äì Custom CSS for advanced theming and layout tweaks.

### 2. **Data Sources & Fetching**
- **Stock Data:**
  - Uses the `tradingview-screener` package to query NSE/BSE stock data via TradingView‚Äôs API.
  - Data is fetched with custom SQL-like queries, supporting filtering, sorting, and multi-field selection.
- **Google Sheets:**
  - News and some dashboard data are fetched from public Google Sheets using pandas‚Äô `read_csv` on published CSV links.
- **Caching:**
  - Streamlit‚Äôs `@st.cache_data` decorator is used to cache expensive data fetches for improved performance and to minimize API calls.

### 3. **Scanner Logic**
- **Multi-EMA Scan:**
  - Filters stocks trading above 50, 150, and 200-day EMAs.
  - Additional filters for price, volume, and market cap.
  - Computes derived metrics (e.g., percent above EMA, percent from 52W high).
  - Results are grouped by industry and sector for easy copy/export.
- **Results Export:**
  - Results can be exported as CSV using Streamlit‚Äôs `st.download_button`.
  - Date parsing and sorting handled with custom helper functions.

### 4. **Visualization & UI**
- **Data Tables:**
  - Uses `st.dataframe` for interactive, scrollable tables with custom column widths and responsive design.
- **Charts:**
  - Donut and box plots are rendered with `plotly.express` for rich, interactive visualizations.
- **Layout:**
  - Responsive two-column layout (parameters/results) on desktop, vertical stacking on mobile.
  - Cards, tabs, and containers organize content for clarity and usability.
  - Custom CSS ensures a modern, clean appearance and fixes for mobile/tablet.
- **Buttons & Interactivity:**
  - Export, refresh, and copy-to-clipboard buttons are contextually placed for usability.
  - All refresh logic uses `st.rerun()` for compatibility with latest Streamlit versions.

### 5. **Deployment & Environment**
- **requirements.txt** lists all dependencies for reproducible setup on Streamlit Cloud or any server.
- **No secrets or API keys** are required for public Google Sheets or TradingView public data.
- **Error Handling:**
  - All data fetches are wrapped in try/except blocks with user-friendly error messages in the UI.

### 6. **Extensibility**
- **Adding Pages:**
  - New dashboards or analytics can be added as new scripts in the `pages/` directory.
- **Custom Styling:**
  - Easily modify or extend `style.css` for branding or layout tweaks.
- **Integration:**
  - Designed for easy integration with new data sources, additional visualizations, or custom logic.
